This is a bootstrap base project for small / non complex PHP modular applications based on Silex framework.

I'm not a fan of PHP but I worked the last 5 months with this language and I met some good stuff to work with. Thinking on having a bundle of tools to start quickly small projects was the reason I made this.

Have fun!

## What does it include?

It uses the following tools:

   - Silex (6d7cf048c7) ([http://silex.sensiolabs.org/documentation](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/documentation))
   - Twig 1.9.1 ([http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation))
   - DBAL 2.2.2 ([http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/index.html](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/index.html))
   - Monolog 1.2.0 ([https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog))
   - (plus their dependencies - don't worry, composer will handle that for you)

## Requirements

The requirement are **PHP >= 5.4** and **Composer** ([http://getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org)).

## Installing dependencies

Before it, install Composer with

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, clone this repo and run the command-line below
    
    php composer.phar install

That's it!
