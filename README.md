This is a bootstrap base project for small / non complex PHP modular applications based on Silex framework.

I'm not a fan of PHP but I worked the last 5 months with this language and I met some good stuff to work with. Thinking on having a bundle of tools to start quickly small projects was the reason I made this.

Have fun!

## What does it include?

It uses the following tools:

   - Silex (dev-master) ([http://silex.sensiolabs.org/documentation](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/documentation))
   - Twig 1.8.2 ([http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation))
   - DBAL 2.2.2 ([http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/index.html](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/index.html))
   - Monolog 1.1.0 ([https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog))
   - (plus their dependencies)
